## Build
The API requires the following envrionment variables, store these in a `.env` file at the route of the directory,
or pass them in through Docker. Boolean env variables are either `true` or `false`. Uppercase will not be detected.

| **Name**              | **Type**| **Description**                                                                               |

Use docker compose to build and run, this will create a mongo instance if you use the local `docker-compose.yml` file.
Or the image can be built using `docker build .`, or can be pulled from `openlab/ongoingness-api`.

## Route Structure
# /
Full docs for routes are found here.

## Auth
| Route | Method | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| /api/auth/authenticate | POST | Returns a JWT token |
| /api/auth/register | POST | Register a user |
| /api/auth/mac | POST | Authenticate with a MAC address |

## Media

| Route | Method | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| /api/media/links | POST | Store a link |
| /api/media/links/:id | GET | Get all links for an item of media |

## Generic Resources
If `x` is the generic resource, then the following routes apply. Routes are in the plural form of the word.
For example a resource such as `device` would be `/api/devices/`.
Media also has these, and the above routes are added on.

| Route | Method | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| /api/x/ | GET | Get all instances of `x`, if `x` is owned resource then it will return all the instances belonging to the user |
| /api/x/ | POST | Will store a record of `x`|
| /api/x/:id | POST | Will update a record of `x` |
| /api/x/:id | DELETE | Will delete `x` |
| /api/x/:id | GET | Will return an instance of `x` |
| /api/x/search/:field/:term | GET | Will return all instances where a field of `x` contains the term |
| /api/x?y=z | GET | Will return all instances of `x` where the field `y` exactly matches `z`. Multiple terms can be applied |
| /api/get/:page/:limit | GET | Will return a subset of `x` for pagination |
| /api/media/links/:id | GET | Get all links for an item of media |

## Testing
Make sure the necessary env parameters for testing are supplied. These are outlined above. Testing is done
within the docker container, to give access to a dockerised MongoDB. First enter the container, then run:
```bash
npm test
```

## Project Structure
### services/
These service files are used to deploy the project without Docker, setting the API and database up as a 
system service.

### static/
Destination for autogenerated API docs.

### test/
Houses unit tests

### web/
Core logic for the API.

#### web/controllers/
Controllers to handle logic associated with resources, do not query or manipulate stored resources.

#### web/middleware/
Middleware for the API. Handles checking JWT tokens, user roles, error handling etc.

#### web/repositories/
Repositories for manipulating and querying stored resources. Custom implementations can be written for different
datastores, see `MongoResourceRepository` as an example. Repositories must implement `IResourceRepository`.

#### web/routes/
Routers for API. For resources the route should be outlined in `RouterSchema`, which will auto generate endpoints
for `CRUD` for that resource. Custom routers can be added but must implement `IResourceRouter` if they are a 
resource, see `MediaRouter` as an example, and all should extend `BaseRouter`.

#### web/schemas/
Used to model resources for Mongo. Should all implement `IBaseMongoResource`. For different data structures a
new data source dependant data structure should be written, and `repositories/RepositoryFactory.ts` should be
extended to use the new interface.
